This folder contains the basic code for file upload and download using Shiny. Shiny has powerful and convenient file Uploading and downloading functions that allow users to upload files for server-side file parsing and processing, and allow users to download reports, tables and data in different formats. This folder contains the simple function that allows users to download Excel spreadsheet, but the Shiny file here can be easily extend to allow the download reports in html, pdf, or word format by including a report template markdown file and modifying the downloadhandler function a little bit.
